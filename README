Here lie dotfiles that I regularly edit/change.

Clone this repository to ~/.dotfiles::

    git clone https://code.google.com/p/yesudeep-dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Put this into your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile

    # Customizations.
    if [ -f ~/.dotfiles/profile ]; then
        . ~/.dotfiles/profile
    fi

Enjoy!
